            <h2>Why should people support animal shelters?</h2>

                    <p>Adopting a pet provides a forever home to an animal in need. Instead of supporting breeders or pet shops that may contribute to animal overpopulation, adopting from a shelter saves lives.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Duration: The adoption process usually takes a few days to a week.</li>
                        <li>Cost: Adoption fees vary but are often much lower than buying from a breeder.</li>
                        <li>Support: Shelters provide support during the adoption process, such as advice on caring for your new pet.</li>

                        <li>Duration: Fostering periods can last from a few weeks to several months, depending on the animal's needs.</li>
                        <li>Cost: While fostering is generally free, some shelters may provide food and medical care during the foster period.</li>
                        <li>Support: Foster families receive guidance and support from shelters, including medical care and pet supplies.</li>

                        <li>Donation Types: Monetary donations, food, blankets, and pet supplies are all highly valued by shelters.</li>
